  <h1>Distorta Caro Syndrome</h1>
  <p>Distorta caro syndrome is the genetic mutation studied by Elias Lancaster. The inspiration for Mr. Lancaster's research into the disorder is Adrian Webb, a 19th century chemistry student commonly believed to have distorta caro syndrome.</p>
  <p>This mutation causes episodes when the individual undergoes extreme physical or emotional stress, including physical attacks on the body (such as gunshots). The mutation itself is activated by extreme or repeated trauma, most commonly during adolescence. Thus, affected individuals typically exhibit strong control over their emotions, but are often diagnosed with mental disorders, usually ones related to trauma.</p>
  <p>During episodes, in order and at varying speeds, the following stages occur:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Internal work. The cells begin speeding up the process of synthesis and mitosis as the brain and/or body begin experiencing what is considered invasive external stimuli.</li>
    <li>The skin and flesh around a specific area loosens, typically the face, limbs, or chest. The cells are much more regenerative, although the subject still feels tremendous pain. There may be signs of this stage, such as skin bubbling, muscles loosening more than is possible, or smelling rotted flesh.</li>
    <li>The bone becomes malleable. The flesh has the consistency of sticky dough. If the subject still experiences elevated stress levels by this stage (roughly an hour in), the flesh will have begun moving and shifting on its own.</li>
    <li>The flesh and bone begin to solidify.</li>
    <li>The body has solidified.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Due to the regenerative properties of the body during episodes, detached limbs can be reattached during stages 2-4. Doing this during stage 3 is the least likely to leave permanent scarring in the tissue. Advanced cellular regeneration also causes difficulty to kill subjects with the disorder, theoretically to the point of near-immortality.<sup>2</sup></p>
