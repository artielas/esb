  <h1>Distorta Caro Syndrome</h1>
  <p>Distorta caro syndrome is the genetic mutation studied by Elias Lancaster.</p>
  <p>This mutation causes the flesh and bone of affected individuals to melt and even move on its own when the individual undergoes extreme physical or emotional stress, including physical attacks on the body (such as gunshots). The mutation itself is activated by extreme or repeated trauma. Thus, affected individuals typically exhibit strong control over their emotions, but are often diagnosed with mental disorders, usually ones related to trauma.</p>
  <p>The inspiration for Mr. Lancaster's research into the disorder is Adrian Webb, a 19th century chemistry student commonly believed to have distorta caro syndrome.</p>
