    <p>Elias Lancaster has locked himself in his laboratory to "further his research with no distraction." If you wish, he is taking questions via his contact information. You may leave food at his door, like M. Saville has been.</p>

    <h3>5-24-2021</h3>
    <p>Floyd Saville has joined the Board! To clear up confusion, they've issued that their name is Floyd-Elizabeth, but they do not mind people just calling them Floyd.</p>
    <p>Her research revolves around artificial life, whether via the <i>Frankenstein</i> route, artificial intelligence and robotics, or a combination of the two.</p>

    <h3>8-18-2019</h3>
    <p>We are happy to announce that we have two new residents on the Board!</p>
    <p>Elias Lancaster is a biochemist and geneticist studying a genetic mutation that runs in his family, although he claims to not have it. If you are interested, we will have a file issued on his research shortly. In the meantime, don't be afraid to introduce yourself! He's not as scary as his appearance may suggest.</p>
    <p>Then there is Jennifer Crane, who is not a scientist. She's a theatre major at a local college, the director has chosen to let her stay with us. We have some ground rules for a non-scientist residing here:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>This really goes for any test subject, but if you use her as a test subject, do not use her in tests that could disfigure, injure, or kill her. Likewise, have a contract for them to sign with clearly written statements, not vague terminology. This is Eclectic Science, not Aperture Science, act like it.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to "outsmart" her only because she's not a scientist. More traditional scientists already think of us weirdly, we do not need the general populace to do so. (This is mostly directed at Dr. Rhodes.)</li>
      <li>Please don't scare her off, she brings donuts.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thank you for cooperating. Please act like the mature adults you are.</p>
