    <p>We are happy to announce that we have two new residents on the Board!</p>
    <p>Elias Lancaster is a biochemist and geneticist studying a genetic mutation that runs in his family, although he claims to not have it. If you are interested, we will have a file issued on his research shortly. In the meantime, don't be afraid to introduce yourself! He's not as scary as his appearance may suggest.</p>
    <p>Then there is Jennifer Crane, who is not a scientist. She's a theatre major at a local college, the director has chosen to let her stay with us. We have some ground rules for a non-scientist residing here:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>This really goes for any test subject, but if you use her as a test subject, do not use her in tests that could disfigure, injure, or kill her. Likewise, have a contract for them to sign with clearly written statements, not vague terminology. This is Eclectic Science, not Aperture Science, act like it.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to "outsmart" her only because she's not a scientist. More traditional scientists already think of us weirdly, we do not need the general populace to do so. (This is mostly directed at Dr. Rhodes.)</li>
      <li>Please don't scare her off, she brings donuts.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thank you for cooperating. Please act like the mature adults you are.</p>
