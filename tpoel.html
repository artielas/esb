  <center><h1>The Peculiarity of Adrian Webb</h1></center>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>M. Fillmore had begun on cellular respiration when the smallest young man entered the classroom. His hair was brown and ragged, as if cut by hand, and white flesh coloured his left cheek. And alas, his wardrobe! The man’s clothes appeared too large for his lean physique, and frayed along the edges. I can almost see him now, unkempt strands of umber hair falling over his face as he hurried into the room.<br>“Ah, welcome!” Fillmore exclaimed. “I regret to say I do not know your name.”</p>
  <p>“Webb,” said he. “I am by the name of Adrian Webb.”</p>
  <p>“M. Webb,” Fillmore repeated. “Please try not to be late to our next meeting.”</p>
  <p>Adrian took the seat beside me, and only cleared his throat and nodded to acknowledge M. Fillmore’s comment. I couldn’t help but take views to him. The clothes he wore were of middle-class status, loose round him still. His collar was tied tight at his neck, scarcely covering the deep white tears in his skin. His eyelashes curled naturally, framing his deep brown irises. His face was angular, yet rounded, and tight scars embedded in his left cheek and the skin surrounding the eye. He was a short, thin shock of a man, abnormally short for his age. The few times he spoke, he had a hard strain on his voice, as if struggling to bring it down an octave. And yet it was high-pitched, more comparable to a schoolboy than an adult man, and he would clear his throat after speaking, before falling silent for great lengths of time.</p>
  <p>When assembly dismissed, Adrian gathered his materials. I managed to catch him before he left; I simply had to investigate him further. “You appear a curious man,” remarked I. “Your accent is southern. Are you from London?”</p>
  <p>He stood in place, pupils receding as his eyes met mine. “No,” said he.</p>
  <p>We conversed for some time, strolling as we awaited our next classes. The more I spoke with him that afternoon, the more queer this young man appeared. His father was a lawyer in Sheffield that wouldn’t let his child go to university, Adrian quitted the residence at the age of seventeen and had remained in an even less stable housing situation in London for the summer, collecting funds for a class. I offered for him to live at my residence, so that he could have his university paid for by my father.</p>
  <p>In the beginning, he declined. “You need not waste your resources on a wretch like me,” he reasoned. “Truly, I am fine! The least I want is to be a bother.”</p>
  <p>“You need not call yourself such!” I cried. “You would never be a bother. My father’s always been the philanthropist type, he would be more than willing to approve your studies.”</p>
