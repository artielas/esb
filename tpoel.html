  <center><h1>The Peculiarity of Adrian Webb</h1></center>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>  I am a native of London and its industrial scene, the geometry of its ornate architecture dating centuries before my time. In childhood, I recall that on occasion, I would sit and study its detail and the depths of its winding passages. My wonder when natural philosophy, nature itself, the beauty of chemistry and biology presented itself to me through these geometric shapes and patterns!</p>
