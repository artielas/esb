His hair was brown and ragged, as if cut by hand, and white flesh coloured his left cheek. And alas, his wardrobe! The manâ€™s clothes appeared too large for his lean physique, and frayed along the edges. I can almost see him now, unkempt strands of umber hair falling over his face as he hurried into the room.</p>
