  <center><h1>The Peculiarity of Adrian Webb</h1>
  <h3>By Dr. Ernest Adams</h3></center>
  <center><h2>Chapter 1</h2></center>
  <p>M. Fillmore had begun on cellular respiration when the smallest young man entered the classroom. His hair was brown and ragged, as if cut by hand, and white flesh coloured his left cheek. And alas, his wardrobe! The man’s clothes appeared too large for his lean physique, and frayed along the edges. I can almost see him now, unkempt strands of umber hair falling over his face as he hurried into the room.<br>“Ah, welcome!” Fillmore exclaimed. “I regret to say I do not know your name.”</p>
  <p>“Webb,” said he. “I am by the name of Adrian Webb.”</p>
  <p>“M. Webb,” Fillmore repeated. “Please try not to be late to our next meeting.”</p>
  <p>Adrian took the seat beside me, and only cleared his throat and nodded to acknowledge M. Fillmore’s comment. I couldn’t help but take views to him. The clothes he wore were of middle-class status, loose round him still. His collar was tied tight at his neck, scarcely covering the deep white tears in his skin. His eyelashes curled naturally, framing his deep brown irises. His face was angular, yet rounded, and tight scars embedded in his left cheek and the skin surrounding the eye. He was a short, thin shock of a man, abnormally short for his age. The few times he spoke, he had a hard strain on his voice, as if struggling to bring it down an octave. And yet it was high-pitched, more comparable to a schoolboy than an adult man, and he would clear his throat after speaking, before falling silent for great lengths of time.</p>
  <p>When assembly dismissed, Adrian gathered his materials. I managed to catch him before he left; I simply had to investigate him further. “You appear a curious man,” remarked I. “Your accent is southern. Are you from London?”</p>
  <p>He stood in place, pupils receding as his eyes met mine. “No,” said he.</p>
  <p>We conversed for some time, strolling as we awaited our next classes. The more I spoke with him that afternoon, the more queer this young man appeared. His father was a lawyer in Sheffield that wouldn’t let his child go to university, Adrian quitted the residence at the age of seventeen and had remained in an even less stable housing situation in London for the summer, collecting funds for a class. I offered for him to live at my residence, so that he could have his university paid for by my father.</p>
  <p>In the beginning, he declined. “You need not waste your resources on a wretch like me,” he reasoned. “Truly, I am fine! I would least like to be a bother.”</p>
  <p>“You need not call yourself such!” I cried. “You would never be a bother. My father has always been the philanthropist type, he would be more than willing to approve your studies. We would get you a proper fitted suit. I conceive that after that, you will no longer think of yourself in that manner.”</p>
  <p>“You have a serving staff, I expect? I believe they wouldn’t want to wait on me alongside you… In fact, the concept of <i>having</i> a serving staff is peculiar to me.”</p>

  <p>“Adrian?” asked I. “My dear Adrian, what are you doing?”</p>
  <p>His head rose from behind the curtain, and when he returned to rest, I could only glimpse the crinkled skin round his eye! “Nothing of your concern,” he insisted, then turned back to the window.</p>
  <p>“But I am concerned!” I approached, dancing round the patches and bundles of red and purple on the floorboards. “There is something terribly wrong with you, my friend! I don’t know quite what yet, but we could discuss it with Mr. Fillmore, surely a man like him would understand!”</p>
  <p>Adrian laughed, a laugh that began light, then torn through with a loud cackle. He contracted into himself once more.</p>
  <p>“Understand?” He cried, trembling. “You believe another man would understand <i>this?</i>”</p>
  <p>Adrian burst to his feet and turned round, meeting me halfway, his hand clutched to his eye as he marched forward.</p>
  <p>“You believe they wouldn’t immediately throw me to the street if they saw me like this?” He laughed again, trembling. “Let me show you!”</p>
  <p>He attempted to withdraw his hand from his face, and it refused. At the edges — where a moment ago it had been pressed so tightly that they mimicked separation — the skin of the fingers had incorporated with the cheek, bone white from the pressure on the elongated skin. Between the thumb and forefinger was an opening, a pocket where the eye resided, glinting madly in the evening light!</p>
  <p>“<i>My own body</i> did this to me! Modern science cannot explain <i>this.</i> To this, I can find no comfort, no rest, no help! I have no trust in the thought of others using me as a source of experimentation, a child’s scientific toy. Do you understand? Do you understand how this cannot leave this place?” He burst into tears, and they slipped through the opening in his melted fingers. Where he had nearly cornered me, he now leaned into my bosom.</p>
  <p>My fingers reached for the door behind me, and crept toward the knob. As I hastily attempted my escape, I could only look into Adrian's welling eyes as he recognized my response.</p>
